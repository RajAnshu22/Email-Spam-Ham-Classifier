The Spam/Ham Email Classifier is a machine learning application designed to classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess email content and three different classification algorithms: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.

## Features

- Classify single email text or bulk email data from a CSV file.
- Preprocess text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and digits.
- Utilize TF-IDF vectorization to transform text data into numerical format.
- Implement multiple classification models and combine their predictions using a majority vote approach.
- User-friendly interface powered by Gradio.
